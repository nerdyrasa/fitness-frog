ASP.NET MVC 5 Forms / Treehouse

This repo is for the development of a fitness-frog web app that follows the Treehouse ASP.NET MVC 5 Forms course. The focus is on forms so the data is not persisted--the code for data management is just a work around solution and in no way represents best practices.

Of course, I am using Github as my central repository. It tracks and manages changes--just do it! Version control is a critical part of the development process. Visual Studio Github extension makes it easy to track changes.
